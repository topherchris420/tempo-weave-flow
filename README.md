# Interval - Temporal Modulation

An ambient temporal modulation app that adapts your subjective experience of time through biometric awareness and environmental feedback.

## Overview

Rather than using timers or calendars, Interval features an adaptive time-shaping engine that subtly shifts audiovisual feedback, interface pacing, and moment transitions to either extend, compress, or dissolve the sense of time based on your current state.

The app passively monitors biometric signals (heart rate variability, breathing, movement), task engagement patterns, and environmental cues to dynamically adjust your temporal perception without intrusive alerts or measurements.

## Core Modules

### üåä Chrono-Sensory Loop
Modulates sounds, hues, ambient textures, and UI rhythm to entrain subjective pacing based on your natural rhythms.

### üß† Attention Phase Mapper
Detects cognitive and emotional phases (stress, calm, flow states) using passive behavioral and biometric signals.

### üé® Moment Sculptor
Assigns symbolic or emotional "weight" to events for future recall intensity, enhancing or fading memories based on their significance.

### ‚è∞ Time Texture Dial
Allows optional conscious input to reshape specific moments - compress a commute, expand a meaningful conversation.

### üåÖ Seamless Feedback Layer
Provides environmental modulation through subtle animation changes, tonal shifts, and background resonance without intrusive notifications.

## Philosophy

Interval is designed to feel like being inside a temporal tuning fork. The UX is intentionally minimalist - no direct time input, no goals, no measurements. The app's purpose is to restore agency over perceived time not through control, but through felt coherence.

## Technical Stack

- **React** - Component-based UI architecture
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling with custom temporal design tokens
- **Vite** - Fast development and build tooling
- **Shadcn/UI** - Accessible component primitives

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone topherchris420/tempo-weave-flow

# Navigate to project directory
cd interval

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Design Principles

- **Ambient Deployment**: Ready for mobile, desktop, or wearable platforms
- **Sensory Integration**: Full sensory feedback is optional but available
- **Passive Monitoring**: No active user input required for core functionality
- **Temporal Coherence**: Subtle environmental shifts create felt time perception changes
- **Minimalist Interface**: Clean, distraction-free experience focused on temporal awareness
